# SnmpPacket

A PHP library to encode/decode SNMP packets.

This library does not aim to implement SNMP protocol processing.
It's just for decoding SNMP messages from binary strings into PHP-objects and vice versa. 

Supports SNMP messages v1, v2c and v3.

This is very early development version.

### Installation

`composer require dface/snmp-packet`
